## Distribution Revolutions

Tired of building warehouses and trade routes for every 8 (9 if you count berries) types of food? That's why I created this.

Add a factory that creates packaged food with multiple food items. Eating packaged foods can satisfy multiple nutritional needs at the same time. There is also a dedicated need for packaged food. This is to give them priority over other foods. 

This should make it easier to manage warehouses and establish trade routes in multiple districts.

Currently, there are four different recipes for packaged foods.
- All foods except berries
- Basic set (carrots, grilled potatoes, bread)
- Grilled set (grilled potatoes, grilled chestnuts, grilled spadderdock)
- Bakery set (bread, cattail crackers, maple pastries)
