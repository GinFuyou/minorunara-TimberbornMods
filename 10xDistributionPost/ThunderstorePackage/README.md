Beavers Edition of Transport Tycoon.

This mod adds a distribution post that grants 10x strength to workers. This means that a beaver can export 100 kg (plus potatoes and other bonuses) and a golem 150 kg at a time.

## Disclaimer!

This mod is currently only supported in the **experimental** version (v0.2.2.1) of Timberborn. Other versions will probably not work (and may crash the game).

## Install

If you install manually, put the downloaded folder in the folder where Timberborn.exe is located \BepInEx\plugins\

Remember that you will also need to install any mods that are dependencies.

## How to use

You should find the 10x Distribution Post under the labor tab.

## Caution
- Workers at distribution posts will not export shipments less than 25% of the weight they can carry.

- The drop-off point has a capacity of only 300 and cannot accept too many routes.

- The 10x distribution post will buffer 150 units of items per route. You can revert by deleting a route.

## Other general tips
- Keep distribution posts and destinations as close as possible. Distance greatly affects efficiency. If the destinations are very far apart, it makes sense to create a relay district in between.

- Beavers do not export when the travel distance is long and close to the end of the workday. To avoid this, use golems. Golems can also carry more than beaver.

- Remember to set district distribution limits correctly.

## Known Issues

The bonus (Swimming Speed +30%) for the 10x Distribution Post is currently not working. This is probably a bug in the vanilla game.
