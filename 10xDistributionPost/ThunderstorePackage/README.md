## Beavers Edition of Transport Tycoon

This mod adds a facility that will help you when you want to build up a transport empire for your beavers.

There are currently 3 facilities.

### 10x Distribution Post

a distribution post that grants 10x strength to workers. This means that a beaver can export 140 kg and a golem 200 kg at a time.

### Drop-off Market

It requires construction costs and is a bit large, but it is a drop-off point that can store 2,000 cargoes.

Furthermore, even if many beavers visit all at once, there is no queue to wait their turn. (In the base game, warehouses and drop-off points can become congested when many beavers visit all at once.) This will be especially useful for packaged food products that are prone to crowding.

### Small Distribution Post

Space-saving 2x2 distribution post. For import/export to/from smaller districts due to low transport capacity.

## Disclaimer!

This mod is currently only supported in version 0.2.5.3 of Timberborn. Other versions will probably not work (and may crash the game).

## Install

If you install manually, put the downloaded folder in the folder where Timberborn.exe is located \BepInEx\plugins\

Remember that you will also need to install any mods that are dependencies.

## How to use

You should find under the labor tab.

## Caution
- Workers at distribution posts will not export shipments less than 25% of the weight they can carry. (except when set by district distribution limits. e.g. if the upper limit of the destination district is 100 and the district has only 99 items, the worker will export only 1 item.)

- The drop-off point has a capacity of only 300 and cannot accept too many routes.

- If multiple routes are to be established for a single drop-off market, the district distribution limits should be carefully set. For example, if the district is set to accept more than 2000 (including âˆž) loaves of bread, the market will be full of bread and will not accept other items.

- The 10x distribution post will buffer 200 units of items per route. You can revert by deleting a route. However, there must be room in the warehouse that is set up to accept the item.

- It is more efficient to have a warehouse to store items to be exported near the distribution center. When daisy-chaining multiple districts, it is a good idea to have drop-off points and distribution posts close together.

## Other general tips
- Keep distribution posts and destinations as close as possible. Distance greatly affects efficiency. If the destinations are very far apart, it makes sense to create a relay district in between.

- Beavers do not export when the travel distance is long and close to the end of the workday. To avoid this, use golems. Golems can also carry more than beaver.

- Remember to set district distribution limits correctly.
